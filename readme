Project Poke!

Things this is expected to do :

	->	Hold a database of 151 original pokemon.
	->	Allow an authenticated admin interface.
	->	Allow PvP battles (upto 5 pokemon in party) of player choice and level.
	->	Log everything! (be verbose).
	
How I will go about doing it :
	
	->	Write many small files, and then integrate them as functions into the main file.
	
Misc Notes

		->	Official base stats from bulbapedia + level gain given by some algo
		
	->	Testing

		->	Should never abruptly terminate. Must always write a log file on error. Must display a user friendly error.
		
	->	Porting
		->	Do not intend to port it to non-unix systems. Will try to ensure unix-like-compatibility (linux, OSX. I only have these two to test it out)
		
	->	Packaging.

		->	Content
			->	Logs
